#The purpose of this project to

# 1) create a server that accepts simulation inputs for a simulation of gravitationally-interacting objects
# 2) run those simulations
# 3) publish the results of those simulations

galaxy simulator to do:

set up very simple server: just display current gif/movie
extend simulation code to 3D
add "restart" function
extend visualizer for non-GIF filetype
write visualizer for 3D-to-2D (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_projection )
develop server to accept simulation parameters and run that simulation
